## Data Analysis Processes Performed 

✅ Data Cleaning : In this step includes removing inconsistencies in data, errors, and duplicates and ensuring that the data with which I worked is accurate and reliable for further analysis.

✅ Data Processing : Creating some new columns that involved organizing, sorting, and filtering the data to extract meaningful insights.

✅ Data Analysis : Used various statistical methods to get valuable insights from the data.

✅ Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib in python. With the help of this, I have created attractive bar, graphs, and interactive visuals to present the data in an easy way.

# Overview

✅ Sales Trends
Sales Trends over Time : Analyze the sales amount over different periods (e.g., months, quarters, and years) to identify any growth trends or fluctuations in sales.
